# Terraforming-Deception:Shaping-the-Attacker's-Reality-Cybersecurity
A Fake Architecture Orchestrator to implement defensive deception in cybersecurity, strategically creating services and components to mislead attackers and divert their attention and resources away from critical assets. 

By creating fake services and components that appear as valuable targets to attackers, defenders can divert the attacker's attention and resources away from critical assets. Attackers might spend time and effort trying to compromise these fake elements, leaving less capacity to target actual valuable assets. The goal of this project is to easily instantiate a complex "fake" infrastructure from an architectural diagram.
